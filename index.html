        <h2>I got bord this winter...</h2>
        <p>
          So I opened my favorate python IDE (PyCharm by JetBrains) and just started typing my bordem away. Two weeks later I had a cute in-terminal Tetris game to show for it!
        </p>

        <p>
          I ran into many issues along the way. I had to learn how to run multiple threads who share an object so that the thread listening to the keybord can report back to the thread displaying the game. In order to avoid memory curruption I had to be creative and think of how my many threads comunicate information to eachother. Each keybord listener thread would copy the gamebord to edit the copy and not the real one to avoid memory problems. The main thread would then wake up and make the sufficient changes to be 'up-to-date' before continuing the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were many bugs along the way. The game is not perfect by any means, but that's the beauty of it: it dosn't have to be. I was playing around with python. It wasn't for a grade, or for one of my employers. It was for me to play around and learn more about this fascinating language. The only real diffrence between a professional programmer and a nocie is how much time and effort they spend working on their programs.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ How did it start?</h2>

        <p>
          One day in eighth grade Math, we were tasked to create an interactive desmos graph. We had two weeks, but I had finished in about half an hour. I created a power function which would change based on a variable set by the user. 
          <br><br>BOORINNNNGGGG<br><br>
          One day, about a week from the deadline, I got curious if I could build a game in desmos. When I told my bestfirend of my plans he said it would be impossible. That's the moment I knew I had to do it. That was the first week I can remember where I had spent less time playing videogames then doing school-work! I was done just hours before the deadline and couldn't be prouder of my accomplishments. "Math really is the language for me" I thought. Little did I know of how much I'd fall in love with programming just years later.
